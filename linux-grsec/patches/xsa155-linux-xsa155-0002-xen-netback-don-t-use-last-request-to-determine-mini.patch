Subject: [PATCH 2/7] xen-netback: don't use last request to determine minimum
 Tx credit

The last from guest transmitted request gives no indication about the
minimum amount of credit that the guest might need to send a packet
since the last packet might have been a small one.

Instead allow for the worst case 128 KiB packet.

This is part of XSA155.
